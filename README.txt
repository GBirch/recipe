A module for sharing cooking recipes

TODO
-----

- Get ingredients into the searchable Index. Requires some SQL expertise. See recipe_update_index()
- emit recipeXML for syndicating recipes. Anyone know of a standard format?
- let users maintain their own recipe collection just like a blog or personal image gallery
- integrate with bookmarks.module so users may create a 'recipe box' listing the favorite recipes
- Views2 support, including ingredients display.
- Add support for Beer homebrew recipes and export into BeerXML 1 or 2-draft.
