Installation
------------

1. Copy this directory to the Drupal modules/ directory. Drupal will
   automatically detect it. Then enable the module.

2. Recommended, but not mandatory. Create a vocabulary (or several) for classifying recipes and associate recipe.module with that vocabulary

3. Recommended, but not mandatory. Install the taxonomy_dhtml.module. You will get a nice taxonomy browser on your main recipe page. This
lets users browse all recipes for 'Fish' or 'Dessert' for example.


Upgraders
---------

If you are upgrading from a version with the Drupal 4.6 module database schema, eg. upgrading drupal from 4.6 to 4.7, or using khalid's 4.7 compatible recipe 
module, then the upgrade procedure is as follows:

1. Rename your recipe table to recipe_old
2. Uninstall the old recipe module, and issue this SQL statement:
	DELETE FROM system WHERE filename='modules/recipe.module';
3. Install the 4.7 module
4. Under admin/menus make the 'import old db' menu option visible, and click 
   on it
5. The import to the new schema should now work, and you can remove the menu 
   option again.

Please let marble (drupal@pebble.org.uk) know if you have any problems with 
this procedure. I hope to make it easier in future releases. This procedure is 
ONLY for the old database schema (with tables named recipe and 
recipe_ingredients). If you have recipe, recipe_ingredient, 
recipe_node_ingredient and recipe_unit, then any required updates should 
happen automatically when you run drupal's update.php.
Note that this import is not perfect, and relies on parsing strings with no 
fixed format. Even if it isn't able to parse out the quantity, unit and 
ingredient name from your ingredients correctly, it should get something 
which at least looks OK. It is strongly recommended that you try it out on a
backup copy of your database first.
