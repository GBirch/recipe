Readme

This module augments your site's search results by incorporating
those external web pages which were linked to from your users' posts.
This has the nice effect of making your site a grand destination for the
topic in which you specialize. It is also handy for assimilating external
knowledge into your own 'knowledge repository'.

Requirements
------------

This module requires the CVS Drupal *AFTER* version 4.0.
This version is currently available in Kjartan's Sandbox in Contrib.

Installation
------------

1. Copy the recipe.module to the Drupal modules/ directory. Drupal should
   automatically detect it. Then enable the module in Settings &
   Filters -> Modules

2. Create the SQL table. This depends a little on your system, but the
    most common method is:
      mysql -u username -ppassword drupal < recipe.mysql
      

TODO
-----

- several bugs which may or may not be related to the new Node API.
- Seems like anonymous users can't view recipes
- Recipe's are not commentable?
- taxonomy display in nodes is not properly implemented. Not sure if this should be done by module or theme in 4.1
- recipe overview should output a yahoo like directory using taxonomy instead a a plain list. this is a geenric need by many modules.
- index/search module needs updating in order that ingredients may be indexed.
