Installation
------------

1. Copy the recipe.module to the Drupal modules/ directory. Drupal should
   automatically detect it. Then enable the module.

2. Create the SQL table. This depends a little on your system, but the
    most common method is:
      mysql -u username -ppassword drupal < recipe.mysql
      
3. Recommended, but not mandatory. Create a vocabulary (or several) for classifying recipes and associate recipe.module with that vocabulary

4. Recommended, but not mandatory. Install the taxonomy_dhtml.module. You will get a nice taxonomy browser on your main recipe page. This
lets users browse all recipes for 'Fish' or 'Dessert' for example.
