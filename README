A fully featured module for sharing recipes

Requirements
------------

This module requires the CVS Drupal or Drupal 4.2.

TODO
-----

- in order to get ingredients in the searchable Index, we need to upgrade search.module 
or stuff all indexable text in the body and store the instructions in the recipe table. Once
that is done, add a search box to the main recipe page.
- emit recipeXML for syndicating recipes. Anyone know of a standard format?
- let users maintain their own recipe collection just like a blog or personal image gallery
- integrate with bookmarks.module so users may create a 'recipe box' listing the favorite recipes
